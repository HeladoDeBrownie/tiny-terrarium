For best results, make sure to read and follow the guidelines included in the source code, especially the style guide.

Examples of contributions likely to be accepted:

- anything addressing an open issue
- adding helpful comments where they are lacking
- rewriting comments to be clearer or more accurate
- ironing out stylistic inconsistencies
- bug fixes, unless they're deemed sufficiently amusing to keep
- performance improvements, so long as they don't substantially compromise readability

Examples of contributions unlikely to be accepted:

- anything that can cause simulation to exceed 100% CPU and thus prevent access to the options screen
- completely changing out assets (e.g., the background music)
- significant changes to how *tt* works at its core
- insufficiently commented code

If in doubt as to whether a contribution would be appreciated, feel free to open an issue or pull request. In most cases, the worst that will happen is it won't be accepted.
